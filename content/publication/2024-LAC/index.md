abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in natural language processing tasks, yet they encounter challenges in complex decision-making scenarios that require long-term reasoning and alignment with high-level objectives. This paper introduces a novel gradient-free LLM-based Actor-Critic framework, termed LAC, which addresses these limitations by integrating both action generation and action evaluation mechanisms. Our approach employs two distinct critics, a language-based critic that provides context-sensitive feedback and a value-based critic that offers quantitative assessments of expected long-term rewards. This dual-critic architecture enhances decision-making by leveraging the complementary strengths of both critics, enabling contextually appropriate and more robust action selection. Additionally, we propose a gradient-free policy improvement method that reduces computational overhead, facilitating efficient updates to the actorâ€™s policy without the complexities of gradient backpropagation. We validate the effectiveness of LAC across diverse environments that cover both high-level action space (ALFWorld) and low-level action space (BabyAI-Text), demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Our method outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines using the same 7B/8B open-source LLMs and even exceeds a strong baseline ReAct using GPT-4 in most settings. Our findings highlight the efficacy and generality of the dual-critic Actor-Critic framework in enhancing LLM-based decision-making.



# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  We propose an LLM-based Actor-Critic algorithm that integrates actor and critic methods in the way that would utilize the merits of the actor-critic algorithm with the strengths of LLMs.
